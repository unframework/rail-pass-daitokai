## Inspirations

I love exploring large urban settings, with those enormous human rivers that public transit creates. This is an attempt to capture some of that experience. I am also delighted by the playful (yet earnest) creative absurdity of unusual Japanese simulators like [Densha De GO!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densha_de_Go!) and [Neko Atsume](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.hit_point.nekoatsume&hl=en). Art inspiration is drawn from [Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com/) and the low-poly movement.
